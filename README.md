# Ammomatic-BO2-ZM


With this mod, you will be able to buy ammo directly on all zombie maps.

Main features:

=Ammo Purchase: You can purchase ammo at any time, with an initial cost of 1500 points.

=Price scaling: With each round you pass, the cost of ammo will increase by 1000 points.

=Reuse time: After each purchase, you must wait 5 minutes before you can buy again.

=Multiplicity of boxes: You can place several ammo boxes on the same map. To add a new box in a specific location, you only need to include the line create_ammo_box((6388, 926, -90)) in the desired map and change the coordinates according to the position you prefer.

=Improved ammo box: Now, the ammo box has movement and looks like a real game element.
